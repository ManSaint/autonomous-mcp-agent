# ‚ö†Ô∏è REPOSITORY STATUS: CLEAN RESTART

**Important Update**: This repository has undergone a complete cleanup and restart.

## üö® Previous "Completed" Status Was False

**Commits before May 26, 2025 claimed fake success:**
- Previous commits claimed "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" and "PRODUCTION READY"
- These claims were based on simulated/fake autonomous execution
- No real tool integration was actually working
- All "success" demonstrations were hardcoded fake responses

## ‚úÖ Current Honest Status (May 26, 2025)

**What's Real:**
- Basic MCP server infrastructure (`minimal_mcp_server.py`)
- Real MCP client implementation (`autonomous_mcp/real_mcp_client.py`)
- Clean project structure for genuine development

**What's Not Implemented:**
- Autonomous execution (removed fake version)
- Tool integration (removed fake version)  
- Workflow orchestration (removed fake version)

## üîÑ Path Forward

Starting fresh with:
1. **Real implementations only** - No simulations or fake responses
2. **Verification at each step** - Manual testing required for all claims
3. **Honest progress reporting** - Clear about what works and what doesn't
4. **Step-by-step rebuild** - Following detailed phase plan

## üìã Ready to Build Real Autonomous Agent

See `CLEAN_RESTART_SUMMARY.md` and the detailed rebuild plan in artifacts for next steps.

**Repository is now clean and ready for genuine autonomous agent development.**

**Status**: Clean foundation ready for real development  
**Last Updated**: May 26, 2025 - After complete cleanup and honest restart
