## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### Intelligent Planning Process
1. **Task Analysis** - Breaks down complex requests into manageable components
2. **Tool Discovery** - Automatically finds the best available tools for each component
3. **Workflow Generation** - Creates optimized execution plans with dependency management
4. **Execution & Monitoring** - Runs workflows with real-time performance tracking
5. **Learning & Optimization** - Learns from results to improve future performance

### Autonomous Decision Making
The agent uses advanced algorithms to:
- **Select optimal tools** based on performance history and task requirements
- **Create efficient workflows** with parallel execution when possible
- **Handle errors gracefully** with automatic retry and fallback mechanisms
- **Learn from usage patterns** to improve recommendations over time
- **Adapt to user preferences** while maintaining optimal performance

## üîß Configuration

### Claude Desktop Setup
The agent automatically configures Claude Desktop during installation. For manual setup:

1. Locate your Claude Desktop config file:
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the MCP server configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "autonomous-mcp-agent": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/autonomous-mcp-agent/mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables are required. The agent automatically discovers and connects to available MCP servers.

## üõü Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tools not appearing in Claude Desktop?**
```bash
# Check MCP server status
python mcp_server.py

# Verify configuration
python -c "import json; print(json.load(open('deploy/claude_desktop_config.json')))"

# Restart Claude Desktop
```

**No tools discovered?**
```bash
# Test tool discovery
python -c "from autonomous_mcp.real_mcp_discovery import RealMCPDiscovery; print(f'Found {len(RealMCPDiscovery().discover_all_tools())} tools')"
```
