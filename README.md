# 🤖 Autonomous MCP Agent - CLEAN RESTART

**Status**: Clean project restart after removing fake implementations  
**Goal**: Build a REAL autonomous agent that actually works  
**Directory**: `D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent`

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: This Project Was Cleaned

This project previously contained fake/simulated autonomous execution that claimed to work but didn't actually call real tools. All fake components have been removed.

## ✅ What's Real and Working

### Current Foundation:
- **`minimal_mcp_server.py`** - Basic working MCP server
- **`mcp_server.py`** - More complete MCP server implementation  
- **`autonomous_mcp/real_mcp_client.py`** - Real MCP client implementation
- **`PROJECT_DIRECTORY_PROTOCOL.md`** - Honesty and verification protocols

## 🔄 Rebuild Plan

See the detailed rebuild plan in the artifacts. The plan includes:

### Phase 0: ✅ COMPLETED - Cleanup
- Removed all fake/misleading files
- Clean project structure created

### Phase 1: Foundation Verification (NEXT)
- Verify MCP server actually works with Claude
- Set up clean development environment

### Phase 2-6: Build Real Autonomous Capabilities
- Single tool integration (web_search, repl, artifacts)
- Tool chaining with real data flow
- Autonomous task planning
- Real-world validation

## 🛡️ Honesty Protocol

This project now follows strict verification protocols:
- **No fake simulations** - All functionality must work with real tools
- **Manual testing required** - Every claim must be verified by testing
- **Honest failure reporting** - When something doesn't work, we say so
- **Transparent limitations** - Clear about what does and doesn't work

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Verify Foundation
```bash
cd "D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent"
python minimal_mcp_server.py --test
```

### 2. Next Steps
Follow the rebuild plan to implement real autonomous capabilities step by step.

## 📊 Current Status

- **Real MCP Infrastructure**: ✅ Available
- **Tool Integration**: ❌ Not implemented (removed fake version)
- **Autonomous Execution**: ❌ Not implemented (removed fake version)
- **Workflow Planning**: ❌ Not implemented (removed fake version)

**We're starting fresh with honesty and real implementations only.**
