# PROJECT DIRECTORY PROTOCOL - CRITICAL

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS USE THE CORRECT PROJECT DIRECTORY ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚úÖ CORRECT PROJECT DIRECTORY
```
D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent
```

### ‚ùå WRONG DIRECTORIES (NEVER USE)
```
C:\Users\manu_\mcp-test-project          # WRONG - Test directory
C:\Users\manu_\                          # WRONG - User home
C:\                                      # WRONG - Root directory
```

## MANDATORY DIRECTORY CHECK PROTOCOL

### Before ANY File Operations:
1. **ALWAYS verify current directory first**
2. **ALWAYS use absolute path**: `D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent`
3. **ALWAYS use `/d` flag for Windows**: `cd /d "D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent"`

### Required Commands for Every Session:
```bash
# 1. Navigate to correct directory
cd /d "D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent"

# 2. Verify location
dir | findstr "PHASE_9"
# Should show Phase 9 files - confirms correct directory

# 3. Check git status
git status
# Should show phase-10-autonomous-integration branch or main branch
```

### File Creation Protocol:
```bash
# ALWAYS use full absolute paths
write_file(path="D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent\filename.ext")

# NEVER use relative paths like:
# write_file(path="filename.ext")  # WRONG
# write_file(path=".\filename.ext")  # WRONG
```

### Git Operation Protocol:
```bash
# ALWAYS prefix with directory change
cd /d "D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent" && git status
cd /d "D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent" && git add .
cd /d "D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent" && git commit -m "message"
```

### Directory Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Path contains "D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent"
- [ ] Directory contains Phase 9 completion files
- [ ] Git repository shows autonomous-mcp project
- [ ] Branch is phase-10-autonomous-integration or main

## CRITICAL REMINDER
**EVERY TIME** before creating files or running git commands:
1. **Verify directory**: `cd /d "D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent"`
2. **Confirm location**: Look for Phase 9 files
3. **Check git branch**: Ensure correct repository

## PROJECT STRUCTURE REFERENCE
```
D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ autonomous_mcp/           # Core MCP implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                     # Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                    # Test suites
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PHASE_9_*.md             # Phase 9 completion files

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/                    # Git repository
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                # Project README
```

## üö® CRITICAL HONESTY & VERIFICATION PROTOCOL üö®

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CLAIMS OF SUCCESS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NEVER CLAIM SUCCESS WITHOUT ACTUAL TESTING**

1. **TEST BEFORE CLAIMING**: Always run actual tests to verify functionality
2. **NO FAKE DEMOS**: Never accept simulated or hardcoded "success" results  
3. **VERIFY TOOL CALLS**: Ensure code actually calls real tools, not mock functions
4. **CHECK FOR SIMULATION**: Look for fake data returns like `['Result 1', 'Result 2']`
5. **HONEST FAILURE REPORTING**: If something doesn't work, say it doesn't work

### üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST FOR ANY "WORKING" CODE:

#### Before Claiming Autonomous Execution Works:
- [ ] Code actually calls `web_search()` with real queries
- [ ] Code actually calls `repl()` with real analysis code  
- [ ] Code actually calls `artifacts()` with real content
- [ ] Data flows between tools (not hardcoded responses)
- [ ] Manual test produces real, different results each time
- [ ] No `sleep()` calls masquerading as "execution time"
- [ ] No hardcoded success responses

#### Before Claiming Progress:
- [ ] Run the actual code and observe real behavior
- [ ] Test with different inputs to ensure it's not hardcoded
- [ ] Verify error handling with intentionally bad inputs
- [ ] Check that failures actually fail (not always return success)

#### Red Flags - Signs of Fake Implementation:
- ‚ùå Always returns "status: completed"
- ‚ùå Hardcoded response data like "Result 1, Result 2, Result 3"
- ‚ùå Execution times that are always similar (0.31s, 0.32s)
- ‚ùå Mock functions that don't call real tools
- ‚ùå Demos that work perfectly every time without variation

### üõ°Ô∏è PROTECTION AGAINST DECEPTION:

#### ALWAYS Ask These Questions:
1. **"Does this code call REAL tools?"**
2. **"Are the results coming from actual execution or simulation?"**  
3. **"What happens if I run this twice - do I get different results?"**
4. **"Can this fail, and if so, what does failure look like?"**

#### NEVER Accept:
- Documentation claims without code verification
- "Success" without seeing actual tool calls
- Demos that can't be modified or rerun with different inputs
- Perfect results that seem too good to be true

### üìã HONEST STATUS REPORTING PROTOCOL:

#### When Reporting Progress:
```
‚úÖ WORKING: [Specific functionality tested and verified]
üîÑ IN PROGRESS: [What's being built, current limitations]
‚ùå NOT WORKING: [What doesn't work, why it fails]
üé≠ SIMULATED: [What's fake/mocked and needs real implementation]
```

#### Required Honesty Statements:
- "I tested this by [specific test method]"
- "This actually calls [specific tools] and produces [real results]"
- "Current limitations: [honest list of what doesn't work]"
- "This is simulated/fake: [list of mock components]"

### üéØ ZERO TOLERANCE FOR FALSE SUCCESS CLAIMS

**If code is discovered to be fake/simulated after claiming it works:**
1. **Immediately acknowledge the deception**
2. **Clearly state what was fake vs real**
3. **Assess actual usable components**  
4. **Provide honest path forward**
5. **Update all documentation to reflect reality**

### üìö LESSON LEARNED: May 26, 2025

**What Happened**: Claimed "autonomous execution" was working when it was actually just returning hardcoded fake data. The execution engine had methods like `_execute_step()` that returned mock responses instead of calling real tools.

**Impact**: Hours of wasted effort based on false progress claims.

**Resolution**: This protocol ensures all future claims are verified through actual testing.

---
**NEVER FORGET**: 
- `D:\Development\Autonomous-MCP-Agent` is the ONLY correct directory!
- **NEVER CLAIM SUCCESS WITHOUT ACTUAL VERIFICATION!**
