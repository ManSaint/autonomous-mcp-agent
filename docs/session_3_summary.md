# Session 3 Summary - Task 1.2 Complete

## Task Completed
âœ… **Task 1.2: Basic Execution Planner**

## Files Created
1. **autonomous_mcp/planner.py** (430 lines)
   - ToolCall dataclass for individual tool calls
   - ExecutionPlan dataclass for complete plans
   - BasicExecutionPlanner class with full functionality

2. **tests/test_planner.py** (290+ lines)
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - Tests for validation, dependencies, merging, export/import
   - Mock-based testing for discovery integration

3. **examples/planner_demo.py**
   - Demonstration of planner usage
   - Shows linear plans, merging, and export/import

## Key Features Implemented

### ToolCall
- Represents individual tool calls with parameters
- Supports dependencies and execution order
- Configurable timeout and retry settings
- Export to dictionary format

### ExecutionPlan
- Complete execution plan with validation
- Circular dependency detection using DFS
- Get tools in execution order
- Full validation with detailed error messages
- Export/import to JSON

### BasicExecutionPlanner
- Creates plans from discovered tools (via discovery system)
- Manual linear plan creation
- Plan merging for complex workflows
- Plan optimization (stub for future enhancement)
- Export/import functionality
- Parameter generation and dependency resolution

## Technical Highlights

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Validates all dependencies exist
   - Prevents future dependencies
   - Detects circular dependencies using graph traversal

2. **Plan Validation**
   - Empty plan detection
   - Duplicate order checking
   - Comprehensive error reporting

3. **Flexibility**
   - Works with or without discovery system
   - Supports manual plan creation
   - Can merge multiple sub-plans

## Next Task
**Task 1.3: Chain Executor**
- Implement executor that uses mcp_chain
- Handle tool outputs and state passing
- Error handling and retries
- Integration with planner output

## Session Insights
- Clean separation of concerns between planning and execution
- Validation is crucial for reliable execution
- Export/import enables plan persistence and sharing
- Dependency management needs careful graph algorithms
