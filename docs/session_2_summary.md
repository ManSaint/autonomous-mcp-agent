# Session 2 Summary - Tool Discovery System

## ðŸŽ‰ Task 1.1: Tool Discovery System - COMPLETED

### What Was Accomplished:

1. **Created `autonomous_mcp/discovery.py`** (19KB)
   - Comprehensive tool discovery and categorization system
   - 10 predefined tool categories with keyword-based detection
   - Capability confidence scoring system
   - Performance tracking (usage count, success rate, execution time)
   - Caching with configurable TTL
   - Export/import functionality for persistence

2. **Created `tests/test_discovery.py`** (12KB)
   - 15 comprehensive unit tests
   - Tests for discovery, categorization, intent matching
   - Performance tracking and caching tests
   - Export/import functionality tests
   - Edge case handling

3. **Updated `autonomous_mcp/agent.py`**
   - Integrated discovery system
   - Added `discover_from_chainable_tools()` helper
   - Placeholder structure for future modules
   - Basic execution flow with discovery

4. **Updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md`**
   - Marked Task 1.1 as complete
   - Added session notes
   - Updated progress tracker (Phase 1: 25%, Overall: 5%)

### Key Features Implemented:

- **Automatic Tool Discovery**: Discovers tools from provided lists
- **Smart Categorization**: 10 categories including file_system, web_interaction, code_development, etc.
- **Intent-Based Matching**: `get_tools_for_intent()` matches natural language to tools
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks usage, success rate, and execution time
- **Caching System**: Reduces redundant discovery operations
- **Confidence Scoring**: Rates how well tools match capabilities

### Example Usage:

```python
# Initialize discovery
discovery = ToolDiscovery()

# Discover tools
tools = discovery.discover_all_tools(tool_list)

# Find tools for intent
matching_tools = discovery.get_tools_for_intent("I need to search for files")

# Get best tool for capability
best_tool = discovery.find_best_tool('file_system', 'read')

# Track performance
discovery.update_tool_performance('read_file', success=True, execution_time=0.5)
```

### Next Steps (Task 1.2: Basic Execution Planner):

1. Create `planner.py` module
2. Implement intent-to-tool mapping
3. Build linear execution plan generation
4. Add basic dependency resolution
5. Create unit tests

### Commit History:
- Initial implementation of discovery.py
- Unit tests for discovery system
- Agent.py integration
- PROJECT_STATUS.md update
