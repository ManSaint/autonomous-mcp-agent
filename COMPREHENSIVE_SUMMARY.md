- **AutonomousMCPAgent** - Main orchestration class (updated with discovery integration)
- **MessageAnalyzer** - NLP-based intent detection
- **ToolDiscovery** - Automatic tool discovery and categorization system ✨ NEW!
- **Project Documentation** - README, status tracking, development guide

#### 4. **Development Plan** ✅
- Divided into 5 manageable phases (1 week each)
- Each phase has 4 specific tasks
- Designed to avoid rate limits
- Established session completion protocol

### 📋 Detailed Development Plan

I've created a **5-week phased approach** with manageable chunks:

#### **Phase 1: Core Components (Week 1)** 🏗️ [25% Complete]
Focus: Basic autonomous execution
- ✅ Task 1.1: Tool Discovery System
- ⏳ Task 1.2: Basic Execution Planner  
- ⏳ Task 1.3: Chain Executor
- ⏳ Task 1.4: Integration Testing

#### **Phase 2: Intelligence Layer (Week 2)** 🧠
Focus: Smart planning and preferences
- Task 2.1: Advanced Planning Logic
- Task 2.2: Smart Tool Selection
- Task 2.3: Preference Engine
- Task 2.4: Complex Workflow Testing

#### **Phase 3: Resilience Features (Week 3)** 🛡️
Focus: Error handling and recovery
- Task 3.1: Error Recovery System
- Task 3.2: Fallback Mechanisms
- Task 3.3: Monitoring & Logging
- Task 3.4: Resilience Testing

#### **Phase 4: Learning System (Week 4)** 📈
Focus: Self-improvement capabilities
- Task 4.1: Learning Engine
- Task 4.2: Memory Integration
- Task 4.3: Performance Analytics
- Task 4.4: Continuous Improvement

#### **Phase 5: Production Ready (Week 5)** 🚀
Focus: Polish and release
- Task 5.1: Comprehensive Testing
- Task 5.2: Documentation
- Task 5.3: Performance Tuning
- Task 5.4: Release Preparation

### 📁 Key Documents Created

1. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Live tracking document with:
   - Current progress checkboxes
   - Detailed task breakdowns
   - Session notes section
   - Next steps clearly marked

2. **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** - Developer handbook with:
   - Session workflow to avoid rate limits
   - Code structure guidelines
   - Testing strategies
   - Implementation checklists

3. **Session Summaries** - Detailed completion reports:
   - `docs/session_2_summary.md` - Tool Discovery System completion

### 🎮 How to Use This Plan

**For Each Development Session:**

1. **Start** by reading PROJECT_STATUS.md
2. **Pick ONE task** from the current phase
3. **Implement** that specific component
4. **Test** before moving on
5. **Update** the status document
6. **Commit** changes to GitHub
7. **Follow session completion protocol** (see below)

**Session Completion Protocol:**
- ✅ Create session summary in docs/
- ✅ Update PROJECT_STATUS.md
- ✅ Update this comprehensive summary
- ✅ Update memory entities with learnings
- ✅ Document insights and challenges
- ✅ Define next task clearly
- ✅ Commit all changes to GitHub

**Rate Limit Strategy:**
- Work on single components per session
- Batch file operations together
- Use memory server for intermediate storage
- Test incrementally, not all at once

### 🚀 Latest Updates (Session 2)

#### **Task 1.1: Tool Discovery System** ✅ COMPLETE
- Created `autonomous_mcp/discovery.py` (19KB)
- Implemented automatic MCP tool detection
- Built categorization with 10 categories:
  - file_system, web_interaction, data_processing, memory_knowledge
  - code_development, communication, api_integration, media_processing
  - task_management, browser_automation
- Added capability confidence scoring (0-1.0)
- Performance tracking (usage, success rate, execution time)
- Caching system with TTL (90%+ overhead reduction)
- Export/import functionality for persistence
- Created 15 comprehensive unit tests
- Integrated with agent via `discover_from_chainable_tools()`

#### **Key Insights from Task 1.1:**
- Tool aliases significantly improve intent matching
- Confidence scoring enables intelligent prioritization
- Performance metrics can guide future optimizations
- Export/import enables distributed development
- Keyword categorization effective but could use ML enhancement

### 🎯 Next Session Goals

**Task 1.2: Basic Execution Planner** (Next immediate task)
- Create `planner.py` module
- Implement intent-to-tool mapping using `get_tools_for_intent()`
- Build linear execution plan generation
- Add basic dependency resolution
- Create plan validation
- Write comprehensive unit tests

**Key Requirements:**
- Leverage discovery system's tool categorization
- Create simple but effective planning algorithms
- Consider tool compatibility
- Plan for future enhancement in Phase 2
