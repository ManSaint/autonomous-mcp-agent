## 💡 Implementation Strategy

### To Avoid Rate Limits:
1. **Work on one task at a time** - Complete each subtask before moving to the next
2. **Test incrementally** - Run tests after each component
3. **Use memory server** - Store progress and intermediate results
4. **Batch similar operations** - Group file operations together

### Development Approach:
1. **Start each session** by checking this status document
2. **Pick the next uncompleted task** from the current phase
3. **Implement and test** that specific component
4. **Update status** before ending session
5. **Commit changes** to GitHub
