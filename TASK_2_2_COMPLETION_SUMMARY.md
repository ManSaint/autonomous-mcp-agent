Smart Tool Selection Algorithms for Autonomous MCP Agent

## üìã What We Built

### Core Component: SmartToolSelector
- **File**: autonomous_mcp/smart_selector.py (812 lines)
- **Purpose**: Machine learning-based intelligent tool recommendation system
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with AdvancedExecutionPlanner

### Key Features Implemented ‚úÖ

#### 1. Multiple Selection Strategies
- **Performance-Based**: Selects tools based on historical success rates and execution times
- **Capability Matching**: Matches user intent keywords with tool capabilities  
- **Hybrid**: Intelligent combination of multiple factors with weighted scoring
- **ML Recommendation**: Similarity-based matching using vectorization and cosine similarity
- **Context-Aware**: Considers conversation history, previous tools, and user preferences

#### 2. Learning and Adaptation System
- **Usage Pattern Learning**: Learns successful tool sequences and combinations
- **Tool Affinity System**: Tracks which tools work well together
- **Success Rate Tracking**: Updates tool performance metrics over time
- **Context Tags**: Associates usage patterns with specific contexts

#### 3. Advanced Scoring Algorithms
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Combines performance, capability, usage, and context scores
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Filters out low-confidence recommendations
- **Dynamic Weights**: Configurable weights for different scoring components
- **Adaptive Learning**: Adjusts recommendations based on historical success

#### 4. Context Intelligence
- **Intent Analysis**: Extracts keywords and capabilities from user intent
- **Previous Tool Consideration**: Factors in recently used tools for sequence optimization
- **User Preference Integration**: Respects user preferences for tool categories and performance
- **Task Complexity Awareness**: Adjusts recommendations based on task complexity

#### 5. Data Persistence
- **Export/Import**: Save and load learning data for continuous improvement
- **Selection History**: Maintains history of selections for pattern analysis
- **Tool Affinity Persistence**: Preserves learned tool relationships
- **Configuration Management**: Saves custom scoring weights and thresholds
