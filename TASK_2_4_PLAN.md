- Test sequential thinking integration with personalized recommendations

### 2. Complex Scenario Testing
- **Multi-step workflows** requiring different tool types
- **Context-dependent decisions** where user preferences matter
- **Adaptive planning** based on intermediate results
- **Cross-domain tasks** spanning multiple tool categories

### 3. Performance & Scalability
- **Stress testing** with large numbers of available tools
- **Latency benchmarks** for intelligence layer overhead
- **Memory usage** during complex planning and execution
- **Learning convergence** for user preferences and tool selection

### 4. Real-World Scenarios
- **Research workflows**: search → analyze → summarize → present
- **Development workflows**: plan → code → test → deploy
- **Data processing**: collect → clean → analyze → visualize
- **Multi-user scenarios**: different users with conflicting preferences

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Research & Analysis Pipeline
**User Intent**: "Research the latest developments in autonomous AI agents and create a comprehensive analysis"

**Expected Intelligence Behavior**:
1. **Sequential Thinking**: Break down into research → synthesis → analysis → presentation steps
2. **Smart Selection**: Choose best research tools based on capability and performance
3. **Personalization**: Prefer user's favorite research sources and analysis tools
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust plan based on quality of research results found

**Success Criteria**:
- Plan includes 4-6 steps with logical dependencies
- Tool selection considers user research preferences
- Execution adapts based on intermediate results
- Final output matches user's preferred analysis style

### Scenario 2: Multi-User Development Workflow
**Setup**: Two users with different preferences:
- **User A**: Prefers thorough testing, detailed documentation, conservative approach
- **User B**: Prefers rapid prototyping, minimal docs, aggressive optimization

**User Intent**: "Plan and implement a new feature for the MCP agent"

**Expected Intelligence Behavior**:
1. **Different Plans**: User A gets test-heavy plan, User B gets prototype-first plan
2. **Tool Selection**: Different development tools chosen based on user style
3. **Execution Style**: Conservative vs aggressive timeout and retry settings
4. **Documentation**: Detailed vs minimal documentation steps

**Success Criteria**:
- Same intent produces meaningfully different plans for different users
- Tool selection reflects user preferences (testing tools for A, prototyping for B)
- Execution parameters adapt to user risk tolerance
- Both approaches are valid but reflect different development philosophies

### Scenario 3: Adaptive Data Processing
**User Intent**: "Process customer feedback data to identify key insights and trends"

**Expected Intelligence Behavior**:
1. **Data Discovery**: Intelligent selection of data source tools
2. **Processing Choice**: ML vs statistical analysis based on data characteristics
3. **Visualization**: Charts/graphs that match user's preferred visualization style
4. **Adaptation**: Modify analysis approach based on data quality discovered

**Success Criteria**:
- Initial plan adapts based on actual data characteristics discovered
- Tool selection considers both data type and user preferences
- Processing methods chosen intelligently based on data volume/complexity
- Final outputs match user's preferred insight presentation format

### Scenario 4: Cross-Domain Collaborative Task
**User Intent**: "Create a comprehensive project plan that includes technical development, user research, and marketing strategy"

**Expected Intelligence Behavior**:
1. **Domain Recognition**: Identify multiple domains (tech, research, marketing)
2. **Tool Diversity**: Select tools from different categories intelligently
3. **Workflow Integration**: Create coherent plan spanning multiple domains
4. **User Expertise**: Weight tool selection based on user's domain expertise

**Success Criteria**:
- Plan spans multiple tool categories coherently
- Tool selection considers user's expertise levels in different domains
- Dependencies between domains are handled intelligently
- Final plan is executable and realistic
